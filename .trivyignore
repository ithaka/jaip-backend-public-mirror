# ESBUILD VULNERABILITIES
# This set of vulnerabilities is in Go 1.23.12, which is used by esbuild, which is a dependency of vite, which is a dependency of vitest. Fortunately, that means esbuild is not used in our production build, and these vulnerabilities are not relevant, to the extent that they're relevant to esbuild at all. See https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4311#issuecomment-3474941120 for more.

# GLOB VULNERABILITIES
# This vulnerability is in glob@10.4.5. It's a fairly deep transitive dependency in some build packages (rollup and vite) for the glob CLI, so it is unlikely to be relevant to our actual use. The version used directly by Fastify is fixed. Leaving an expiration date on there to revisit this in a few months.
