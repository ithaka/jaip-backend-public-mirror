# This set of vulnerabilities is in Go 1.23.12, which is used by esbuild, which is a dependency of vite, which is a dependency of vitest. Fortunately, that means esbuild is not used in our production build, and these vulnerabilities are not relevant, to the extent that they're relevant to esbuild at all. See https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4311#issuecomment-3474941120 for more.
