# Typically, a Capstan pipeline would include a promote stage (see
# https://wiki.ithaka.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=softdel&title=The+container+image+promotion+process).
# However, since we are pulling an image from a remote repo, promotion:
# * does not work (the image is not located where the promotion job would look)
# * is not necessary (the deploy script will look at the remote repo before
#   looking through our snapshot/rc/stable repos).

# See Dockerfile. Note that the contents of the repository are _ignored by
# default_ and only built into the app when explicitly exempted in the
# .dockerignore. This is because the top-level repo contains lots of apparatus
# for test, CI, etc. that we don't actually need to deploy. In other words, if
# you have reached this comment because you're confused that your app builds
# fine locally with npm run build but isn't deploying properly, check the
# .dockerignore and consider whether you have recently added files or
# directories that you need to build.
